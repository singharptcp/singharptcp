### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Arpit, and I recently graduated with a master's degree in computer science from the University of Texas at Dallas. I am a passionate full-stack developer, and I feel fortunate to be a part of Copart, where I have the opportunity to work, learn, and grow as a software engineer. Currently, I am focused on enhancing the UI experience under the guidance of Abdul Cutlerywala and Nikhil Narula. 
  Outside of the tech world, I am a culinary enthusiast who enjoys experimenting with flavors. I also love connecting with people, hearing their stories, and am always up for a quick chat over lunch. I look forward to getting to know all of you soon, learning from your experiences, and implementing that knowledge to ensure my code is bug-free.
